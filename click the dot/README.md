# Game description
This game is about clicking dots to connect lines. Each dot has a number indicating its order. The time limit is 20 seconds, and if you press the next dot within 2 seconds, the time limit is increased by 1 second. When the time limit runs out or all 10 dots are pressed, the game ends and the time limit (score) appears on the last screen.

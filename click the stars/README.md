# Game description
When you start this game, you can choose the difficulty level. The object of the game is to click on the red star among the moving stars. There are two difficulty levels: easy and hard. If you select easy mode, stars will fall from above. Hard mode generates random stars from above or below and is faster than easy mode. If you click on a star of a different color, the game ends. In hard mode, the game ends even if you click on a different colored star or background. After the game is over, you can try again by pressing the enter key.
